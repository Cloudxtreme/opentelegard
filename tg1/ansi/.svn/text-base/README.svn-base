What is this?
-------------
This is the ANSI graphic file storage folder. Included are 2 test ansi
graphics from the ICE collection. These should NOT be distributed with 
the final release, as we will make our own. They exist here strictly
for proof of concept, and we take no credit for these designs.

welcome.ans	- This file should be a native UTF-8 character set compat
welcome.ans.dos	- MS-DOS compatible ansi. Do we care in the end?
