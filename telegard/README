== About
OpenTelegard is a recreation of the Telegard Bulletin System 
implemented in JRuby. Its goal is to be an open-source project to recreate
the Telegard BBS from scratch into a modern, internet ready, and standard
system.  Telegard was BBS software developed in the late 80’s and 90’s by 
a team of developers as part of the dial-up modem era.

=== What are the Goals?
* Set new standards for BBS software.
* Recreate the feel and configureability of Telegard.
* Design using a modular architecture for easy extendability.
* Build using modern open-standards (language, compilers, libraries, etc).
* Make Internet Ready on both IPv4 and IPv6, and in theory any newer protocol 
  stacks such as RINA.
* Integrate with current internet Mail Gateways as well as support some legacy 
  BBS networks such as FidoNET.
