${color.reset}TelegardEdit is a simple, line by line ANSI editor. It does not support full
screen capabilities such as those of Nano, Le, Vim, and so forth. This is a
line by line input compatible with legacy terminals such as those used for
connecting to BBS systems. To use this editor, simply type your text. Line
wrapping occurs on the 79th character of each line. Note this does not
append a Carriage Return or break the actual word. Available commands are:

/A      Abort the editor, do not save.
/H      This Help Message.
/P      Preview the message and make changes to a particular line.
/X      Save and Exit the editor.
