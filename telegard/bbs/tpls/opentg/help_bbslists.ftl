BBS Lists provide a directory of similar BBS systems. There are two types of
directories provided by Telegard/2:

1) Local   : Local directories are unique to this system and contain entries
             manually added by this system's visitors or operators.

2) Network : Network directories are provided by a network of which this
             system is a member. Network directories are obtained from an
             upstream authority and cannot be modified locally.

Users of this system with appropriate permissions may add a listing to the
local directory. Some networks may not provide a centralized BBS Listing
facility.
