Telegard/2 Menu Input is designed for a single keypress without the [ENTER] key
to submit the request. A special set of slash or "shortcut" commands can be
used to toggle specific user preferences, see who's online, or logout without
having to navigate through countless menus to reach the feature. Issuing '/?'
at most menu prompts will display a listing of available commands.
