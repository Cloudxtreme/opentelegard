What is this?
-------------
This is the OpenTelegard/2 Project (OpenTG) distribution. OpenTG is an 
opensource project dedicated to reinventing and modernizing the BBS. 
The concept is based on recreating the look and feel of Telegard, 
integrated as an Operting SubSystem ontop of another Operating System. 

OpenTG is a Ruby application built around the JRuby platform.
